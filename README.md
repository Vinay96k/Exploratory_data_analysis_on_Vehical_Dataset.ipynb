# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Automobile Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `autos_dataset1.csv` dataset. The goal of this analysis is to explore and understand the structure and relationships in the dataset, helping to gain insights and draw conclusions about the data.

## Contents
- `EDA(Exploratory data analysis).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and visualizations for performing EDA.
- `autos_dataset1.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (not included in the repo).

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

## Key Analysis
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Loading the automobile dataset and performing initial inspection (e.g., checking missing values, summary statistics).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables if needed.
3. **Data Visualization**: Using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships between variables.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Evaluating statistical correlations and other features of interest.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Open `EDA(Exploratory data analysis).ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells.
